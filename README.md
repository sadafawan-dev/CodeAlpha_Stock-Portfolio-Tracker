# 📊 Stock Portfolio Tracker  

## 📘 Overview  
This project focuses on building a simple command-line stock portfolio tracker that calculates the total investment value based on predefined stock prices. It demonstrates Python fundamentals such as dictionaries, loops, and file handling.  

## 🎯 Objective  
To create a simple tool that calculates total investment value from user-input stock names and quantities using hardcoded stock prices.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Accepts user input for stock names and quantities  
- Uses a predefined dictionary to store stock prices  
- Calculates total investment value  
- Optionally saves results in a `.txt` or `.csv` file  
- Simple and user-friendly console interface  

## 🧠 Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Dictionaries for data storage  
- Loops and conditional statements  
- File handling (optional)  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. A dictionary stores stock symbols and their corresponding prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250}).  
2. The user enters stock names and quantities.  
3. The total investment value is calculated by multiplying quantity by price.  
4. The result is displayed and optionally saved to a file.  

## 💡 Example Output  
Enter stock name: AAPL
Enter quantity: 5

Enter stock name: TSLA
Enter quantity: 3

Your total investment value is: $1650
Results saved to portfolio.txt
