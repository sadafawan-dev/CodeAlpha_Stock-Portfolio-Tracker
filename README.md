# 💬 Basic Chatbot  

## Overview  
This project focuses on building a simple rule-based chatbot that can respond to basic user inputs such as greetings and farewells. It demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts like conditional statements, loops, and functions.  

## Objective  
To design a text-based chatbot that provides predefined responses to user input using simple rule-based logic.  

## Features  
- Responds to user inputs such as “hello”, “how are you”, and “bye”  
- Uses rule-based logic with if-elif statements  
- Interactive text-based console interface  
- Easy to modify and extend with additional responses  

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- If-elif statements  
- Functions and loops  
- Console input/output  

## How It Works  
1. The chatbot receives user input from the console.  
2. It checks the input using if-elif statements to find a matching predefined response.  
3. The chatbot prints the appropriate reply to the console.  
4. The conversation continues until the user types “bye”.  

## Example Conversation  
You: hello
Bot: Hi!

You: how are you
Bot: I'm fine, thanks!

You: bye
Bot: Goodbye!
