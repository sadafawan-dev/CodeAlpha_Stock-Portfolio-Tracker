📊 Stock Portfolio Tracker
📘 Project Overview

This Stock Portfolio Tracker project was developed as part of my Python internship at CodeAlpha.
The goal of this project is to create a simple command-line tool that calculates a user's total investment value based on predefined stock prices.

The program allows users to input stock names and quantities, then retrieves corresponding prices from a hardcoded dictionary. It computes the total investment and can optionally save the result to a .txt or .csv file.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in Python fundamentals, dictionary operations, and file handling, while learning how to simulate basic financial calculations.

🎯 Objective

To build a simple stock tracking tool that calculates total investment value from predefined stock data.

🚀 Features

Accepts user input for stock names and quantities

Uses a hardcoded dictionary for stock prices

Calculates and displays total investment value

Optionally saves results in a .txt or .csv file

Simple and efficient command-line interface

🧠 Tech Stack

Python

Dictionary for storing stock-price pairs

File handling for saving investment summaries

Basic arithmetic operations

⚙️ How It Works

Define a dictionary with stock names and their prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250}).

The user enters stock symbols and quantities.

The program calculates the total investment by multiplying quantity by stock price.

Displays the total investment value on the console.

Optionally saves the output in a .txt or .csv file.

💡 Example Output
Enter stock symbol: AAPL  
Enter quantity: 5  
Enter stock symbol: TSLA  
Enter quantity: 2  

Total Investment Value: $1,400  
Results saved in portfolio.txt
